Description: process and system monitoring tool
 In terminal graphical metrics for your *nix system written in Rust.
 .
 Zenith is like top or htop but with zoom-able charts for CPU,
 GPU (NVIDIA only), network, and disk usage in addition to process listing.
 .
 This package contains binaries built with both NVIDIA Graphics card support
 (zenith.nvidia) and without (zenith.base) with the "zenith" shell script
 that will choose the appropriate one depending on NVIDIA support at runtime.
